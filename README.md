## Context

This module was developed as part of the **TwIN** project promoted by **TwIN Lab** within the **digital twins** initiative of the **Government of Navarre** and **Ayuntamiento de Pamplona**.

Its purpose is to provide a hands-on learning environment for creating **interactive 3D visualizations** on the globe through the integration of [Cesium for Unreal](https://cesium.com/platform/cesium-for-unreal/) with **Unreal Engine 5**.

## Repository Contents

- `/Documentation` → Step-by-step documentation and tutorials.  
- `AirTraffic.zip` → **Unreal Engine 5** project, including:  
  - Basic Cesium configuration and georeferencing.  
  - Blueprints for consuming external APIs (e.g., OpenSky) and visualizing dynamic objects in the world.  
  - Examples of interactive visualization.  
  - Link to the WebODM video: https://youtu.be/48DFShBO9hM

## Module Objectives

- Understand the integration between **Cesium** and **Unreal Engine 5**.  
- Learn how to consume **real-time geospatial data APIs**.  
- Represent interactive and dynamic objects (aircraft, vehicles, etc.) on the globe.  
- Develop a reusable workflow for future digital twin projects.
